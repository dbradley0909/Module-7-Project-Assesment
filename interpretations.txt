interpretations of results: It seems the extra large 
array was the only array that stood out from the
 rest because when calculating the formula one of
  the functions runtime was linear and the other one 
  slightly linear. Both had huge gaps when charting 
  in excel, also, im not sure if i did the
  calculations correctly for it to do this, 
the large array was negative for some odd, didnt understood why
 that was maybe because of the calculations. but all functions 
 seemed to be linear
 except extra large array where there was a difference between 
 the runtimes.As far as scaling better i would say 
 small and tiny their
  runtimes were almost the same.
 those 2 runtimes would have taken up less
  time to respond to a single request. 

  extra credit:
  I would say that extra- large array would have been the slower function because when charting the data on excell
  i seen a a huge jump from the start and stop times while the other functions had runtimes were really close to one another

  another thing i dont know why excel deleted to of the charts data but it was 
  there before i submitted it
